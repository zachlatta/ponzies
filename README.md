# Ponzies

Ponzies was a startup sticker ponzi scheme. You could mail us a startup (or
hackathon) sticker and we'd send two stickers in return (_*While supplies
last_).

This was a fun project [@maxwofford](https://github.com/maxwofford) and I
made when Hack Club printed our first sticker back in 2015. In total, Ponzies
made it to the front page of Hacker News and we received hundreds of
envelopes in the mail from dozens of countries.
